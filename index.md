## Abstract
__PRINTEMPS__ is a C++ metaheuristics modeler/solver library for general linear integer optimization problems. PRINTEMPS emphasizes the following aspects:
- __Portability.__ It is implemented as a header-only library which does not depend on any other proprietary or open-source libraries. Users can integrate it into their own codes by just copying the necessary files. 

- __Intuitiveness in modeling.__ It provides an intuitive modeling environment to define an optimization model as a program code. Users can define constraint and objective functions using arithmetic operations on decision variables.

- __Flexibility to define neighborhood.__ It automatically detects the neighborhood structure of the problem. In addition to this, PRINTEMPS also accepts user-defined neighborhoods.

## Algorithm
PRINTEMPS can compute approximate solutions for __integer linear programming problems__ by  __Weighted Tabu Search__ [1]. For more information on the algorithm, please refer to the literature [2]. The figure below shows the flow-chart of the algorithm of PRINTEMPS.

## Installation
Installation of PRINTEMPS is just completed by cloning the [repository](https://github.com/snowberryfield/printemps/) (or downloading the [latest archive](https://github.com/snowberryfield/printemps/releases)) and then copying the [`printemps/`](https://github.com/snowberryfield/printemps/tree/master/printemps/) directory in the repository to an appropriate location. 

## Example
Let us consider a simple linear integer optimization problem [3]:
```
   (P1):  minimize       x_1 + 10 x_2
             x
         subject to   66 x_1 + 14 x_2 >= 1430,
                     -82 x_1 + 28 x_2 >= 1306,
                     x_1 and x_2 are integer.
```

The following code shows an implementation code to solve the problem (P) using PRINTEMPS.
```c++
#include <printemps.h>
int main(void) {
    // (1) Modeling
    printemps::model::IPModel model;

    auto& x = model.create_variables("x", 2);
    auto& g = model.create_constraints("g", 2);

    g(0) =  66 * x(0) + 14 * x(1) >= 1430;
    g(1) = -82 * x(0) + 28 * x(1) >= 1306;
    model.minimize(x(0) + 10 * x(1));

    // (2) Running Solver
    auto result = printemps::solver::solve(&model);

    // (3) Accessing the Result
    std::cout << "objective = " << result.solution.objective() << std::endl;
    std::cout << "x(0) = "      << result.solution.variables("x").values(0) << std::endl;
    std::cout << "x(1) = "      << result.solution.variables("x").values(1) << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```
By compiling the code above and then running the generated executable, users will obtain the following result:
```bash
objective = 707
x(0) = 7
x(1) = 70
```
Following additional examples are provided in [`example/`](https://github.com/snowberryfield/printemps/tree/master/example/) directory.
- [`example/knapsack.cpp`](https://github.com/snowberryfield/printemps/tree/master/example/knapsack.cpp) solves a knapsack problem which considers maximization of total prices of items to be included in a "knapsack" with satisfying two constraints, volume and weight capacities. 
- [`example/bin_packing.cpp`](https://github.com/snowberryfield/printemps/tree/master/example/bin_packing.cpp) solves a bin-packing problem which considers minimization of the number of bin to pack all given items. 
- [`example/sudoku.cpp`](https://github.com/snowberryfield/printemps/tree/master/example/sudoku.cpp) solves a "Sudoku" puzzle [4] as a binary integer programming problem.

## Compilation
A C++ program integrating PRINTEMPS can be compiled by C++17 standards compatible compilers with specifying include search path where it is installed. For instance, the example code [`example/knapsack.cpp`](https://github.com/snowberryfield/printemps/tree/master/example/knapsack.cpp) can be built by the following command using g++:
```
$g++ -std=c++17 -O3 -I path/to/printemps [-fopenmp] sample/knapsack.cpp -o knapsack.exe
```

The option `-fopenmp` is required to activate parallel computation. See [Solver Option Guide](./contents/solver_option_guide.md) for details.

Following combinations of operating systems and compilers are confirmed compilation possible:

| Operating System | Compiler (version)                                                 |
|:----------------:|:-------------------------------------------------------------------|
|     macOS 12     | gcc (11.4.0, 12.4.0, 14.1.0_2)                                     |
|     macOS 13     | gcc (11.4.0, 12.4.0, 14.1.0_2)                                     |
|     macOS 12     | gcc (11.4.0, 12.4.0, 13.3.0, 14.1.0_2)                             |
|   Ubuntu 22.04   | gcc (10.5.0, 11.4.0, 12.3.0) <br /> clang (13.0.1, 14.0.0, 15.0.7) |
|   Ubuntu 24.04   | gcc (12.3.0, 13.2.0, 14.0.1) <br /> clang (16.0.6, 17.0.6, 18.1.3) |

## Standalone Solver
A standalone executable solver based on PRINTEMPS is also provided. It approximately solves a pure integer programming problem described as MPS (Mathematical Programming System) format file. The solver can be built by the following command:
```
$make -f makefile/Makefile.application [CC=gcc CXX=g++]
```
where the options `CC` and `CXX` respectively designate the paths of C and C++ compilers, which should be specified according to the user's development environment. The built solver will be generated at `build/application/Release/mps_solver.exe`.

The solver can be run by the following command:
```
$./mps_solver.exe mps_file [-p option_file] [--accept-continuous] 
```
where the argument `mps_file` is the path of the MPS file. The argument `-p option_file` is optional and it specifies solver options and parameters via a JSON file. If the optional flag `--accept-continuous` is activated, the solver accepts an MPS file which includes continuous variables. Then the continuous variables will be regarded as integer variables. An example of solver option JSON file is provided as [`application/dat/option.json`](https://github.com/snowberryfield/printemps/blob/master/application/dat/option.json).

## Documents
- [Starter Guide](./contents/starter_guide.md) describes the basic usage of PRINTEMPS including modeling of optimization problems, running the solver, and accessing the optimization results.
- [Solver Option Guide](./contents/solver_option_guide.md) gives a detailed description of the all options and their default values.


## Benchmark
Optimization performance of PRINTEMPS has been evaluated using pure integer instances of [MIPLIB 2017](https://miplib.zib.de). Please refer [Benchmark Results](./contents/benchmark/index.md) for detail.


## Test
The test suites for PRINTEMPS are powered by [googletest](https://github.com/google/googletest). The command
```
$make -f makefile/Makefile.external [CC=gcc CXX=g++]
```
installs googletest into `external/` directory. The options `CC` and `CXX` respectively designate the paths of C and C++ compilers, which should be specified according to the user's development environment. After the installation of googletest, execute the command
```
$make -f makefile/Makefile.test
```
to build and run the test suites.
